### Angular Setup

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions installed:
* Angular 5 Snippets
* Angular Language Service
* TSLint or ESLint
* npm

Download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't have it

Run `npm install -g typescript`
Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`
Clone this repo
Run `ng serve` for dev server and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
